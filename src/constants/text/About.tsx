          I am John Syslo, a quarter-stack programmer, and student exploring the world of computer
          science in my freetime. I code <i>sometimes</i> for a little, with no real
          &quot;finished&quot; projects.

          Currently, I am taking Web Development as a freshman at Lane Tech, with AP CSA on the way
          next year. You can find me learning how to make efficent and good looking dynamic
          websites, after I threw myself into something completely new one weekend.

          I got into coding around 4th grade with the help of the computer teacher at my school. I
          had always had an interest in electronics and figuring out how things work, I loved to
          take things apart, figure out how it worked, and put them back together if I could. I
          started off working with the{' '}

          and after a while eventually moved to the{' '}

          . I worked on these things for years until I started teaching myself HTML & CSS in 7th
          grade, and in the summer of 8th I created my first{' '}

          Nowadays I am less active with programming after having taken a break for a good while
          over the summer and losing some interest. It is slowly coming back which is what lead to
          the creation of this site, I hope to get back into it and learn even more!
