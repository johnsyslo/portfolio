          I currently have very few projects as I am learning by myself every day. For the ones I
          have most of them are personal with a couple for school. I hope to grow this library soon,
          but for now here are the ones I am most proud of.

            Micro:bit

          , a reacreation of all my old Micro:bit block code in Typescript! Not much of anything but
          cool to me because I was able to take long code statements and shrink them, showing how
          much I have improved.

            Portfolio
          </Link>
          , my portfolio is my very first React project, by using Next.js and TailwindCSS I was able
          to learn the basics of react. With components, app routing, and providers being used
          within my site.
